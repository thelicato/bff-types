## ðŸ›¸ Motivation
<p align="center">

</p>
The motivation is simple: when working on a **Typescript** project usually we have common types shared between different projects (e.g. *backend* and *frontend*). What happens is that when something changes in one of the projects it becomes painful and time-consuming to find the source of the problem. ``bff-types`` is a simple template that you can **customize** and install into your projects to have everything aligned. For example I always like to work using the **monorepo** approach and my folder structure is the following:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ backend
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend
â””â”€â”€ bff-types
```

## ðŸ‘¾ Usage
The usage is very simple. You just need to:
1. Clone the repo
2. Change the info in the ``package.json`` (like *name*, *description*, *version* and so on)
3. Customize the ``index.d.ts`` with your own types
4. Install it in your projects!

To install a local package (using the directory structure presented before) you just need to run:
```
yarn add ../bff-types
```

Of course you need to **reinstall it** in your project every time there you make an update.
